We use git as a versioning tool 
Git is used as a version control tool for software development due to its ability to track changes, enable collaboration among developers, support branching for concurrent work, provide traceability through commit history, offer backup and recovery options, facilitate open-source collaboration, operate with speed and efficiency, and accommodate non-linear development for complex projects.
